## Facial Verification System using Siamese Neural Networks
# Introduction
This repository contains a facial verification system implementation based on Siamese Neural Networks. The system is designed to verify whether two facial images belong to the same person by learning a similarity metric, rather than classifying specific identities.
Siamese Neural Networks are particularly effective for facial verification tasks as they can be trained on pairs of images to determine their similarity. This approach is especially valuable when dealing with limited training data per identity or verifying identities not seen during training.
# Project Overview
This implementation provides an end-to-end solution for facial verification, including:

- Face detection and alignment preprocessing
- Feature extraction using a Siamese architecture
- Similarity computation and threshold-based verification
- Evaluation metrics for system performance
